Abstract
My team was tasked to present an area of opportunity in an existing platform and innovate by any means, except for actual technical restraints. We decided on tackling means of education and people’s learning habits and from there we only needed to choose a platform, and that platform was YouTube. After extensive research, we proceeded with the design process and ended up with 3 iterations.
Why YouTube?
This project gave us a chance to take on almost whatever we wanted. As a team, consisting of Alexa Szal and Shelda Eason and myself, we discussed our interests to narrow down on what we’d like to take on. While we had different interests, we all had education in mind. From there it was all about picking a platform on where to do so. YouTube being one of the internet’s biggest source, and our source, of consuming information along with other content, we figured YouTube can leverage the massive conglomerate that it is and introduce a platform where people can go to specifically learn.
Research: Screener Survey
All tools: Google, Google Forms, Google Docs, Google Sheets, Laptop, Paper, Pencil, Sticky notes, Voice recording app
The purpose of screener surveys are primarily used to identify potential participants to make sure we recruit enough people for user interviews, but useful information was also gained out of the survey. 100% of people who have taken the survey have told us that they seek information online, and over 90% of those people use YouTube to do so. We also asked about their monetary spending habits towards online learning, and 54% have told us they do not spend money for online learning. 88% of people who took our survey says that they prefer to do their online learning on a desktop computer.
We also questioned and let our users rate the importance of following features during their online learning experience. Those following features are; proof of completion, ease of access, price, ability to track their progress, and legitimacy. We learned that the most important features for online learners are ease of access, price, and legitimacy.
Research: Analyses
Several types of analyses were performed. First, a comparative analysis is when several other similar websites are being compared amongst one another based on features and elements to identify what makes that particular website tick. The websites we compared amongst each other are Lynda, Coursera, Howcast, WikiHow, Udemy, and Edx.
Elements and features that were easily observable were duly noted, such as their headline and contents of their primary navigation bar. The key points that we learned from the comparative analysis was how each learning platform makes their revenue, what devices they are available for, how they structure their content, where their content comes from, and guidelines towards publishing content on their website. Essentially looking for what features define those websites and if there is anyway we can utilize their successful features in our YouTube learning platform.
A heuristics analysis based on Abby Covert’s methodology was performed as well. A heuristics analysis is a practical methodology for good design. Based on Abby Covert’s heuristics we’ve determined that in terms of online learning, YouTube falls short in terms of the following;
Clear: Is the path to task completion obvious and free of distraction? Would a user find it easy to describe?
Usable: Are users able to complete the task that they set out to do without massive frustration or abandon? Are there a few navigation options that lead where users may want to go next? Are they clearly labelled?
Credible: Is the design appropriate to the context of use and audience? Is it easy to verify your credentials? Do you have help/support content where it is needed?
Delightful: What are your differentiators from other similar experiences or competitors? How are user expectations not just met but exceeded? What can you take now that is ordinary and make extraordinary?
Research: User Interview</p>

<p>The questions we asked our users spawned from our interest in the answers they’ve submitted in the screener survey. In regards towards which device they prefer to participate in online learning, they responded:
“Desktop because bigger screen! And, I can plug it into a bigger screen and allows me to take notes or play with software at the same time.” — Di
“Dual screens and do the process with the video as opposed to watching the video and applying it later.” Connor
“It depends what I’m learning, my schedule. For coding, desktop would be best.” — Stephanie
“Doing anything on mobile that’s complex is impossible. Mobile is for quick information. Ideally, at home or at a coffee shop with headphones and on a desktop.” — Liz
So we opted for prioritizing the desktop experience first. And in regards towards the structure and findability of content on YouTube, people said:
“Lynda.com is direct — it has structure. YouTube videos sometimes have nothing to do with the subject. ” — Liz
“There are multiple videos, which one would I actually wanna watch.. there’s no way to know unless someone in comments about it or an article was written about it.” — Connor
“The volume of results that show up. [The search results] are kind of a blessing and a curse. It’s tedious scanning and reading and finding exact info you want.” — Stephanie
“Coursera gives you a course guideline and agenda, which helps you to guide where you are at in the curriculum and you can check your progress.” — Amelia
With what our users told us, we needed to keep in mind that content has to be filtered somehow. YouTube currently does have the ability to filter videos by a number of options, but they do not cater specifically towards what users are looking for when participating in online learning. We’ve also questioned people about their thoughts towards the legitimacy and credibility of the content on YouTube in terms of how they learn online:
“Legitimacy of courses is based on people’s reviews, if the person sounds and looks like she knows what she is talking about. Programs like Coursera already have credibility.” — Amelia
“The websites I use are curated” — Sunil
“Coursera offered lots of university classes so that speaks to legitimacy. I feel YouTube lacks it but, its free videos.” — Stephanie
Curated videos make people feel safe about the content that they are viewing so that’s exactly what this YouTube platform will provide. Content created for this new service will need some sort of incentive, so we also asked about their monetary spending habits towards online learning:
“Seems like a lot of stuff is free online.” — Liz
“[Online learning] is cheap and free” — Sunil
“Besides learning, the flexibility that allows you to learn. The financial benefit. The fact that you’re not paying.” — Stephanie
“I never paid for online courses. It’s free, everything on the internet is free. I’m not gonna pay for education. lynda.com is paid but I think I can find an almost as good video for free.” — Connor
People are not inclined to pay for a service to learn because the internet is very accessible and provides free information already, so we then questioned them about how we would go about incentivizing creators to make content for this platform in addition to YouTube’s ads:
“I paid for Coursea because you get a certificate and can post on LinkedIn. I like the ability to place completion on LinkedIn.” — Amelia
“I wouldn’t mind a badge or an animation” — Sunil
People stated different things. Some stated that they would like to be given something equivalent to a certificate to demonstrate their mastery of a skill learned on this platform or something as small as an animation to congratulate them for their accomplishment.</p>

<p>Synthesis: Affinity Mapping</p>

<p>Common technique in UX to organize the data, affinity mapping. Affinity mapping is basically laid out all of our user interview notes and observed behaviors into sticky notes on a wall. This helped us organize everything our users have said, and while observing the results we identified common trends, annotated and reorganized stickies on the wall when needed.</p>

<p>Synthesis: Feature Prioritization
Adding everything we wanted to our YouTube platform would be ideal, but considering technical restraints and whether users actually want what we suggest, we can’t add everything. So, based on user interviews we brainstormed solutions to their problems, put those solutions on stickies and mapped it out on a chart. One spectrum was labelled “nice-to-have” and “essentials” and on another spectrum we had “low effort/expense” and “high effort/expense”.</p>

<p>Feature Prioritization chart
Soon after, we then used moscow method to see what would actually make the cut. The meaning behind moscow isn’t too important but what it stands for is:
Must have: Guidelines, badge of recognition, ratings, progress tracking, notes section, filters/categorization, “apply knowledge” section
Should have: Comments section, playlist queue, accountability notifications, interactive annotations, community constructed flashcards
Could have: Offline feature, wish-list of courses, text version and video, collaboration with Department of Education, bio section
Won’t have: Live Classroom Broadcasting
Synthesis: Personas
Personas are fictional characters created based on user interviews. Rather than remembering all the people we’ve interviewed, we would refer to the persona created, to remind ourselves that design decisions should satisfy the users not us. With the information provided by the user interviews, we created 3 personas:</p>

<p>Design: Design Studio</p>

<p>During this stage, we sat down and drew out all our ideas in quick sketches. We provided feedback on each of our ideas, what we liked and what he didn’t like.</p>
